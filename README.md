# dropbear_lstm
DROPBEAR LSTM model

## LSTM model of the DROPBEAR experiment

An attempt to develop a Python version of the previous Matlab model.

Trains many times slower than the equivalent Matlab model.  I'm not sure why.

Usage:
Modify sweep parameters as needed near top of file.

Run with:
`./dropbear_lstm.py
